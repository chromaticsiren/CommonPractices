4. Before deploying in server in eclipse do the following:
  Step #1: Click on Servers tab to see your server.(Eclipse toolbar -> Window Menu -> Show View -> Servers)
  Step #2: Right click on the server, select Properties, you will see the following window. Click on Switch Location, it will change the location to the one shown in the image below from the default one.Click on Apply and then OK to close the window.
  (Optional) Step #3: Double click on the Tomcat Server which will open the Overview option as shown in the image below. The Server Locations part was active for me when I did (it's shown inactive in the image because I already did that at my end and I have my server running) that and I selected the second radio button option which is Use Tomcat installation (takes control of Tomcat installation). I then closed this option , saved the changes when prompted and started my server.
